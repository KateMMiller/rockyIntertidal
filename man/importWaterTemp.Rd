\title{importWaterTemp: Import compiled water temperature and buoy data}
\usage{
importWaterTemp(path = NA, simplify = TRUE, new_env = TRUE, buoy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Quoted path of database backend file, including the name of the backend.}

\item{simplify}{Logical. If TRUE (default), will simplify dataset to only include 1 water
temperature measurement per high tide event by selecting the value closest in time to high tide.
This will speed up processing and plotting time. If FALSE, will keep all values that are within
2 hours of high tide.}

\item{new_env}{Logical. Specifies which environment to store views in. If \code{TRUE}(Default), stores
views in ROCKY environment. If \code{FALSE}, stores views in global environment}

\item{buoy}{Logical. If TRUE (default), imports compiled buoy data for ACAD (station 44034)
and BOHA (station 44013)}
}
\value{
Rocky intertidal compiled water temperature data in specified environment
}
\description{
This function imports compiled water temperature data collected within 2 hours of high tide.
User must specify the path where the compiled logger data are stored, then imports and defines date fields
as POSIXct dates. Buoy data are also imported if buoy = TRUE and the files exist in the specified path.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

# Import water temp data with defaults (new_env = T, simplify = T)
path = "Z:/PROJECTS/MONITORING/Rocky_Intertidal/NETN/5_Data/Data_Files/Temperature/Compiled_HT_water_temps_2011-2022/"

importWaterTemp(path = path)

# Import full water temp dataset into global environment
importWaterTemp(path = path, new_env = F, simplify = F)
