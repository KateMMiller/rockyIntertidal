\title{sumEchinoCounts: summarize counts of echinoderms}
\usage{
sumEchinoCounts(
  park = "all",
  location = "all",
  plotName = "all",
  species = "all",
  years = 2013:as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "\%Y")),
  QAQC = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{park}{Include data from all parks, or choose one.
\describe{
\item{'all'}{Includes all parks monitored in the network}
\item{'ACAD'}{Includes only sites in Acadia National Park}
\item{'BOHA'}{Includes only sites in Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area}
}}

\item{location}{Include data from all locations, or choose specific locations based on location code.
\describe{
\item{'all'}{Includes all locations returned by other filter arguments in function}
\item{"BASHAR"}{Bass Harbor, ACAD}
\item{"LITHUN"}{Little Hunter, ACAD}
\item{"LITMOO"}{Little Moose, ACAD}
\item{"OTTPOI"}{Otter Point, ACAD}
\item{"SCHPOI"}{Schoodic Point, ACAD}
\item{"SHIHAR"}{Ship Harbor, ACAD}
\item{"CALISL"}{Calf Island, BOHA}
\item{"GREISL"}{Green Island, BOHA}
\item{"OUTBRE"}{Outer Brewster}
}}

\item{plotName}{Filter on plot name. Options include: c("all", "X1", "X2", and "X3")}

\item{species}{Filter on species code. Options include:
c("all", "ASTFOR", "ASTRUB", "HENSAN", "STRDRO"). If a new species is added, the
function will warn the user that an unrecognized species was specified in case it was an error.}

\item{years}{Filter on year of data collected. Default is 2013 to current year.
Can specify a vector of years.}

\item{QAQC}{Logical. If FALSE (Default) does not return QAQC events. If TRUE,
returns all events, including QAQC events. If TRUE, also returns QAQC_SameGrid and QAQC_NewGrid fields.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame of location-level echinoderm data filtered by function arguments
}
\description{
This function summarizes location-level average, median, min and max counts
by park, location, plot name, and species.
