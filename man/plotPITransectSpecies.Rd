plotPITransectSpecies(
  park = "all",
  location = "all",

  species = "all",
  palette = c("default"),

}
\arguments{
\item{park}{Include data from all parks, or choose one.
\describe{
\item{'all'}{Includes all parks monitored in the network}
\item{'ACAD'}{Includes only sites in Acadia National Park}
\item{'BOHA'}{Includes only sites in Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area}
}}

\item{location}{Choose specific location based on location code.
\describe{
\item{'all'}{Includes all locations returned by other filter arguments in function}
\item{"BASHAR"}{Bass Harbor, ACAD}
\item{"LITHUN"}{Little Hunter, ACAD}
\item{"LITMOO"}{Little Moose, ACAD}
\item{"OTTPOI"}{Otter Point, ACAD}
\item{"SCHPOI"}{Schoodic Point, ACAD}
\item{"SHIHAR"}{Ship Harbor, ACAD}
\item{"CALISL"}{Calf Island, BOHA}
\item{"GREISL"}{Green Island, BOHA}
\item{"OUTBRE"}{Outer Brewster}
}}

\item{plotName}{Filter on plot name (transect). Options include: c("all", "T1", "T2", and "T3")}

\item{species}{Filter on species code. Options include:
c("all", "ALGBRO",  "ALGGRE", "ALGRED", "ARTCOR", "ASCEPI", "ASCNOD", "BARSPP",
"BOLT", "CHOMAS", "CRUCOR", "FUCEPI", "FUCSPP", "KELP", "MUSSPP", "NONCOR",
"OTHINV", "OTHSUB", "PALPAL", "PORSPP", "ROCK", "ULVENT", "ULVINT", "ULVLAC",
"UNIDEN", "WATER"). If a new species is added, the function will warn the user
that an unrecognized species was specified in case it was an error. The default
color palette will also need to be updated, if a new species is added. The viridis palette
will work with new species without adaptation, but labels will only be species codes.}

\item{palette}{Choices are "default" or "viridis". Default assigns logical colors to common species.
Viridis uses a color-blind friendly palette of blues, purples and yellows.}

\item{xlab}{Quoted text label for x axis. If not specified, defaults to 'Distance (m)'}

\item{ylab}{Quoted text label for y axis. If not specified, defaults to 'Elevation MLLW (m)'}

\item{years}{Filter on year of data collected. Default is 2013 to current year.}

\item{facet}{Logical. If TRUE, will plot species in separate facets. FALSE (default) plots all species
on one figure.}

\item{title}{If TRUE (Default) prints the full site name on the figure. If FALSE, does not
include plot title.}

\item{rev_axis}{Logical. If TRUE (default), the Y axis will be year and the x axis will be elevation. If
FALSE, the Y axis will be elevation and x will be year.}

\item{QAQC}{Logical. If FALSE (Default), does not return QAQC events. If TRUE,
returns all events, including QAQC events.}

\item{drop_missing}{Logical. If TRUE (Default), drops bolts with missing
elevation and distances and drops bolts that are not bolt 1 but have a distance of 0.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot object of point intercept species detection data filtered by function arguments
}
\description{
This function plots species by bolt elevation a given park, location, and years.
The point for each species is the median elevation across the three transects for that year.
The thicker lines on the error bars are the 25\% and 75\% quantiles of elevation across the transects.
The thinner error bars that end with vertical lines are the minimum and maximum elevation detected
along the three transects.
